  abstract = {This paper tries to solve the location-constrained virtual network embedding (LC-VNE) problem efficiently. We first investigate the complexity of LC-VNE, and by leveraging the graph bisection problem, we provide the first formal proof of the NP-completeness and inapproximability result of LC-VNE. Then, we propose two novel LC-VNE algorithms based on a compatibility graph (CG) to achieve integrated node and link mapping. In particular, in the CG, each node represents a candidate substrate path for a virtual link, and each link indicates the compatible relation between its two endnodes. Our theoretical analysis proves that the maximal clique in the CG is also the maximum one when the substrate network has sufficient resources. With CG, we reduce LC-VNE to the minimum-cost maximum clique problem, which inspires us to propose two efficient LC-VNE heuristics. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that compared with the existing ones, our proposed LC-VNE algorithms have significantly reduced time complexity and can provide smaller gaps to the optimal solutions, lower blocking probabilities, and higher time-average revenue as well.},

In this paper, we propose a novel VNE algorithm that aims to maximize the infrastructure provider's revenue from serving virtual network (VN) requests, with the help of the global resource information. The proposed algorithm, named as revenue-driven VNE (RD-VNE), adopts a node-ranking approach that takes the global resource information into account in a recursive manner to assist the greedy node mapping, and leverages the shortest-path routing for link mapping. Our simulation results suggest that the proposed VNE algorithm outperforms two existing VNE algorithms that also take global resource information into consideration, in terms of request blocking probability, and brings higher time-average revenue to the infrastructure provider (InP).},

The proposed algorithm aims to maximize the revenue and to minimize the cost of the infrastructure provider (InP). Based on GRC, the proposed algorithm applies a greedy load-balance manner to embed each virtual node sequentially, and then adopts the shortest path routing to embed each virtual link. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed GRC-VNE algorithm achieves lower request blocking probability and higher revenue due to the more appropriate consideration of the resource distribution of the entire network, when compared to the two lastest VNE algorithms that also consider the resources of entire substrate network. Then, we introduce a classical reserved cloud revenue model, which consists of fixed revenue and variable one. Based on this revenue model, we design a novel admission control policy selectively accepting the VNR with high revenue-to-cost ratio to maximize the InP's profit based on an empirical threshold. Through extensive simulations, we observe that the optimal empirical threshold is proportional to the ratio of variable revenue to the fixed one.},

The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm considers the uniqueness of O-OFDM networks and outperforms two reference algorithms that directly apply the VNE schemes developed for Layer 2/3 or WDM network virtualization, by providing lower VON blocking probability. The simulations with a realistic topology also demonstrate that the average lengths of embedded substrate paths are well-controlled within the typical transmission reaches of O-OFDM signals.

In this paper, we investigate how to serve multicast requests over EONs with multicast-capable routing, modulation level, and spectrum assignment (RMSA). Both EON planning with static multicast traffic and EON provisioning with dynamic traffic are studied. For static EON planning, we formulate two integer linear programming (ILP) models, i.e., the joint ILP and the separate ILP. The joint ILP optimizes all multicast requests together, while the separate ILP optimizes one request each time in a sequential way. We also propose a highly efficient heuristic that is based on an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) with minimum solution revisits. The simulation results indicate that the ILPs and the GA provide more efficient EON planning than the existing multicast-capable RMSA algorithms that use the shortest path tree (SPT) and the minimal spanning tree (MST). The results also show that the GA obtains more efficient EON planning results than the separate ILP with much less running time, as it can optimize all multicast requests together in a highly efficient manner. For the dynamic EON provisioning, we demonstrate that the GA is also applicable, and it achieves lower request blocking probabilities than the benchmark algorithms using SPTand MST.},

  abstract = {Based on the concept of infrastructure as a service, optical network virtualization can facilitate the sharing of physical infrastructure among different users and applications. In this paper, we design algorithms for both transparent and opaque virtual optical network embedding (VONE) over flexible-grid elastic optical networks. For transparent VONE, we first formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model that leverages the all-or-nothing multi-commodity flow in graphs. Then, to consider the continuity and consecutiveness of substrate fiber links' (SFLs') optical spectra, we propose a layered-auxiliary-graph (LAG) approach that decomposes the physical infrastructure into several layered graphs according to the bandwidth requirement of a virtual optical network request. With LAG, we design two heuristic algorithms: one applies LAG to achieve integrated routing and spectrum assignment in link mapping (i.e., local resource capacity (LRC)-layered shortest-path routing LaSP), while the other realizes coordinated node and link mapping using LAG (i.e., layered local resource capacity(LaLRC)-LaSP). The simulation results from three different substrate topologies demonstrate that LaLRC-LaSP achieves better blocking performance than LRC-LaSP and an existing benchmark algorithm. For the opaque VONE, an ILP model is also formulated. We then design a LRC metric that considers the spectrum consecutiveness of SFLs. With this metric, a novel heuristic for opaque VONE, consecutiveness-aware LRC-K shortest-path-first fit (CaLRC-KSP-FF), is proposed. Simulation results show that compared with the existing algorithms, CaLRC-KSP-FF can reduce the request blocking probability significantly.},

Both the crossover and mutation schemes in our proposed GA operate adaptively based on the fitness of individuals. Specifically, when the individuals are not fit yet, their genes can be modified significantly with crossover and mutation. On the other hand, for individuals that are already fit, we limit the crossover and mutation rate to avoid chromosomal disruption. The simulation results with the NSFNET topology and up to 1000 lightpath requests show that the proposed adaptive GA converges faster with better optimization performance, when comparing to a non-adaptive one. For the 1000-request case, the proposed algorithm can converge with a relatively small population size (e.g. 50) within 80 generations.},

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic multi-path provisioning algorithm for O-OFDM based elastic optical networks. The algorithm tries to set up dynamic connections with single-path routing in a best-effort manner. When a connection cannot be served with a single routing path, the algorithm uses an auxiliary-graph based approach to calculate a multi-path provisioning scheme based on two parameters, i.e., the differential delay upper-bound and the bandwidth allocation granularity.

Specifically, we propose to provision each multicast request with a light forest, which consists of one or more light trees to avoid the dilemma that because of the accumulated physical impairments, a relatively large light tree may have to use the lowest modulation level, and, hence, consume too many frequency slots (FS'). In order to further improve the spectral efficiency and compensate for the differential delays among the light trees, we incorporate the rateless network coding (R-NC) in the multicast system. We first formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to solve the problem for static network planning. Then, we propose three time-efficient heuristics that leverage the set-cover problem and utilize layered auxiliary graphs. The simulation results indicate that in both the ILP and heuristics, the MC-RMSA with R-NC can achieve better performance on the maximum index of used FS' than that without. After that we evaluate the heuristics in a dynamic network provisioning. The results show that the MC-RMSA with R-NC can effectively improve the performance of all-optical multicast in EONs to reduce the blocking probability.},

  abstract = {In an optical inter-datacenter (inter-DC) network, for preventing data loss, a cloud system usually leverages multiple DCs for obtaining sufficient data redundancy. In order to improve the data-transfer efficiency of the regular DC backup, this paper investigates fast and coordinated data backup in geographically distributed (geo-distributed) optical inter-DC networks. By considering a mutual backup model, in which DCs can serve as the backup sites of each other, we study how to finish the regular DC backup within the shortest time duration (i.e., DC backup window (DC-B-Wnd)). Specifically, we try to minimize DC-B-Wnd with joint optimization of the backup site selection and the data-transfer paths. An integer linear programming (ILP) model is first formulated, and then we propose several heuristics to reduce the time complexity. Moreover, in order to explore the tradeoff between DC-B-Wnd and operational complexity, we propose heuristics based on adaptive reconfiguration (AR). Extensive simulations indicate that among all the proposed heuristics, AR-TwoStep-ILP achieves the best tradeoff between DC-B-Wnd and operational complexity and it is also the most time-efficient one.},

  abstract =  {Bandwidth defragmentation, i.e., the operation to reconfigure existing connections for making the spectrum usage less fragmented and less misaligned, has recently been recognized as one of the most important features for elastic optical networks (EONs). In this paper, we propose a novel comprehensive bandwidth defragmentation algorithm that considers the problems of 1) When to defragment? 2) What for defragment? and 3) How to defragment? jointly. The proposed algorithm accomplishes defragmentation through proactive network reconfiguration that only reroutes a portion of existing connections. In each defragmentation operation, we first choose the connections to reroute using a selection strategy, then determine how to reroute them with the defragmentation based routing and spectrum assignment (DF-RSA), and finally perform rerouting with best-effort traffic migration to minimize traffic disruptions. Simulation results indicate that in order to make the bandwidth blocking probability (BBP) comparable with that from the Greenfield scenario (100% rerouting all the time), the proposed algorithm only needs to reroute ~30% existing connections. The simulations also demonstrate that the traffic disruption percentages are less than 1% for defragmentations with 30% rerouting and can be further reduced to within 0.25% by adding a move-to-vacancy (MTV) approach in the traffic migration.},

The algorithm offers an efficient way of serving the dynamic lightpath requests based on the current network status at each service provision time. The GA is designed for multi-objective optimization. For low traffic cases when there is no blocking, the GA minimizes the maximum number of slots required on any fiber in the network; otherwise, it minimizes the blocking probability. The performance of the proposed GA is evaluated in dynamic RMSA simulations with the 14-node NSFNET and the 28-node US Backbone topologies, and the results show that it converges within 25 generations. The simulation results also verify that the GA-RMSA outperforms several existing algorithms by providing more load-balanced network provisioning solutions with lower blocking probabilities. Specifically, when the traffic load is same, the GA can achieve more than one order-of-magnitude reduction on blocking probability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve dynamic RMSA in elastic O-OFDM networks with a GA.},

  abstract = {It is known that multicast provisioning is important for supporting cloud-based applications, and as the traffics from these applications are increasing quickly, we may rely on optical networks to realize high-throughput multicast. Meanwhile, the flexible-grid elastic optical networks (EONs) achieve agile access to the massive bandwidth in optical fibers, and hence can provision variable bandwidths to adapt to the dynamic demands from the cloud-based applications. In this paper, we consider all-optical multicast in EONs in a practical manner and focus on designing impairment- and splitting-aware multicast provisioning schemes. We first study the procedure of adaptive modulation selection for a light-tree, and point out that the multicast scheme in EONs is fundamentally different from that in the fixed-grid wavelength-division multiplexing networks. Then, we formulate the problem of impairment- and splitting-aware routing, modulation and spectrum assignment (ISa-RMSA) for all-optical multicast in EONs and analyze its hardness. Next, we analyze the advantages brought by the flexibility of routing structures and discuss the ISa-RMSA schemes based on light-trees and light-forests. This paper suggests that for ISa-RMSA, the light-forest-based approach can use less bandwidth than the light-tree-based one, while still satisfying the quality of transmission requirement. Therefore, we establish the minimum light-forest problem for optimizing a light-forest in ISa-RMSA. Finally, we design several time-efficient ISa-RMSA algorithms, and prove that one of them can solve the minimum light-forest problem with a fixed approximation ratio.},
